## 2. Position PID control at Stepper Motor

<p align="justify">
This code in the stepperPIDcontrol folder has position control with a PID. The sensor that measures the position is a potenciometer and the output signals is by using the ULN2003 driver.
</p>

## 3. XBEE send a DATA

<p align="justify">
This code in the xbee_sendData sends a string DATA with Zigbee protocol.
</p>

## 4. XBEE PID position control

<p align="justify">
This code has a position controller for a continuous servo. The feedback sensor is a rotative encoder, the senpoint is sending by a computer with ZigBee Protocol and the arduino send to computer the encoder position data. The figure shows the prototype.
